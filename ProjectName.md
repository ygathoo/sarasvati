[Sarasvati](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saraswati) is both the name of river and of a Hindu Goddess. This project is named in honor of the goddess. According to Wikipedia:

> Her name literally means "the one who flows", which apparently was applied to thoughts, words, or the flow of a river...

The patron deity of all that flows seems a worthy namesake for a workflow engine.
