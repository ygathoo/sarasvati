      Let us start with a simple process definition, the classic 'Hello
      World'. When executed, this process will print out 'Hello, World!'
      and then complete.
</p><div class="section" title="Legend"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="concepts-legend"></a>Legend </h3></div></div></div><p>
        First, we introduce a graphical notation for process definitions and
        execution. Not all the symbols will make sense immediately, but
        they will all be explained.
</p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/legend.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p></div><div class="section" title="Single Node"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="concepts-single-node"></a>Single Node </h3></div></div></div><p>
        The simplest useful process definition would consist of a simple node.
        Here is the graphical representation:
</p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts1.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        How will this process be executed? First the engine needs to determine
        where to start execution.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Start Node</em></span>
            - A node at which a token will be placed when process
            execution begins.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        There are various ways of handling this. For example, there may be a
        specific type of node designated for start positions. All nodes
        of this type will have tokens placed in them at process start.
        Alternately, nodes may have an attribute which indicates whether
        or not they are a start node, allowing any node to be a start
        node. Sarasvati takes this second approach.
</p><p>
        Assuming that the 'Hello World' node is a start node, execution
        would begin by creating a new
        <span class="emphasis"><em>node token</em></span>
        at the 'Hello World' node.
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Node Token</em></span>
            - A token situated at a node. Node tokens track the response
            of the node guard (see below). They may also have
            attributes.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        With the addition of the node token, the process would now look like:
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts1-1.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        As you can see, the node now has an active node token stationed on it.
      </p><p>
        At this point the node has not yet been executed. Before it can
        be, its
        <span class="emphasis"><em>guard</em></span>
        would need to be invoked.
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Node Guard</em></span>
            - Nodes have functionality associated with them, which will
            be executed when a node token is accepted into the node.
            However, before a node is executed, its guard will be
            executed. The guard is allowed one of three responses:
          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="circle"><li class="listitem"><p>
                <span class="emphasis"><em>Accept</em></span>
                - The node will be executed.
              </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
                <span class="emphasis"><em>Discard</em></span>
                - The node token will be marked as discarded and the
                node will not be executed.
              </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
                <span class="emphasis"><em>Skip</em></span>
                - The node will
                <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
                be executed, however, processing will continue as if the
                node had completed execution normally.
              </p></li></ul></div></li></ul></div><p>
        By default, a node's guard will return Accept. The node will
        then be
        <span class="emphasis"><em>executed</em></span>
        . This should cause 'Hello, World!' to be printed out.
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Node Execution</em></span>
            - When a node is executed, whatever custom logic has been
            assigned by the developer will run. To complete node
            execution, the node must inform the engine that that the
            given node token has been completed. Node completion may
            happen synchronously as part of the execution of the node
            function or it may happen later, asynchronously.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        As there are no further steps in the process, it is now
        <span class="emphasis"><em>complete</em></span>
        and looks like:
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts1-2.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Process Completion</em></span>
            - A process with no active tokens is considered complete.

        Let's now example a slightly more complicated example. Instead of a
        single node, we'll have two, the first of which prints out
        'Hello', the second prints out 'World'. It looks as follows:
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts2.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        The
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Hello</em></span>
        node is a
        <span class="emphasis"><em>predecessor</em></span>
        of the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>World</em></span>
        node. This dependency is indicated by the directed arc.
      </p><p>
        As the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Hello</em></span>
        node is marked as a start node, a node token will be placed
        there when the process begins executing.
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts2-1.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        When the node token on
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Hello</em></span>
        is completed, an
        <span class="emphasis"><em>arc token</em></span>
        will be generated on the outgoing arc.
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts2-2.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Arc Token</em></span>
            - A token situated on an arc. Arc tokens exist so that
            nodes know when to execute. Arc tokens may not
            have attributes.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        Whenever an arc token is created on an arc, the <span class="emphasis"><em>join strategy</em></span> of the
        node at the end of the arc is evaluated, to determine if the node is ready to have a node token
        created at that node. The only time join strategies are not used is when a process is started.
        At that time all start node will have node tokens created on them.
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
            <span class="emphasis"><em>join strategy</em></span>
            - A join strategy determines if a node token should be created on a node. Evaluation
            of the join strategy is generally initiated by the processing of an arc token
            on an incoming arc to the node. The join strategy will determine two things:
          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="circle"><li class="listitem"><p>
                  <span class="emphasis"><em>Is the join complete?</em></span> Some join strategies require multiple arc tokens to
                  be present before a node token is created on the node. Others may be satisfied every
                  time an arc token arrives.
                </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
                  <span class="emphasis"><em>Which arc tokens completed the join?</em></span> Every arc token that

                </p></li></ul></div></li></ul></div><p>
         Since the arc on which the arc token is situated goes into a
        node using the<span class="emphasis"><em>or join strategy</em></span>
        , a node token will be created on
        <span class="emphasis"><em>World</em></span>
        immediately.

            <span class="emphasis"><em>or join strategy</em></span>
            - The or join strategy will allow a new node token

            stands in contrast to a <span class="emphasis"><em>label-and join strategy</em></span>
            , where active arc tokens must exist on all incoming arcs
            with the same name.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        The process now looks like:
</p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts2-3.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        The
        <span class="emphasis"><em>World</em></span>
        node will now run its guard and then execute. Finally the node
        token will be completed.

        Let us now examine an example which contains concurrent execution.
      </p><p>
        The process describes an approval process.
        </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
              A request is made
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              Two approvals must be obtained
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              The request is granted
      </p></li></ol></div><p>

        The process looks like:
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts3.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        This a simplified system, since it does not allow approvals to be
        denied.
</p><p>
        There is more than one way that this process could be executed.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
            If the approvals are granted by people, the nodes will
            almost certainly be executed asynchronously. This means that
            when a token arrives at
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Approval 1</em></span>
            , the node will generate a notification to the user who is
            to do the approval. The token will then enter a
            <span class="emphasis"><em>wait state</em></span>
            . Execution may continue elsewhere in the process, but this
            token will wait until the user enters the system and grants
            approval.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            If approvals are done by software which does a check and
            then returns immediately the tokens will not have enter a
            <span class="emphasis"><em>wait state</em></span>
            , but may continue immediately.
          </p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Wait State</em></span>
            - When a token enters a node and the node is executed, it
            may choose not to immediately continue process execution at
            the end of the node method. In this case the token will
            remain in the node until it is complete asynchronously.
            While the token is waiting to be completed, it is considered
            to be in a wait state.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        Let us view process execution for both these cases, starting with the
        case where approvals are done by people and thus tokens will
        need to enter wait states.
</p><p>
        Execution will begin as usual, by placing a node token in the nodes marked as
        being start nodes.
</p><p>
        The
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Request</em></span>
        node will be executed. It generates a task for the requester to
        complete. Until the requester has filled out out the request and
        completed the task, the token will be in a wait state. During
        this time the process will look like:
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts3-1.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Question:</em></span>
        What happens once the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Request</em></span>
        has been completed? Which arc or arcs will arc tokens be
        generated on?
      </p><p>
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Answer:</em></span>
        Sarasvati requires that an arc name be specified when completing
        a node token. All arcs with this name will have arc tokens
        generated on them.
      </p><p>
        Some things to note:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
            Most arcs have no name specified. They are considered to have the
            'default' name.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Usually when completing a node token, the default arc name will be given.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Each arc will have an arc token placed on it in turn. No specific
            order is guaranteed
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            When an arc token is placed on an arc, it will continue on to its end
            node immediately and see if the node can be executed.
      </p></li></ul></div><p>
        So now the node token on
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Request</em></span>
        has been completed and arc tokens will be generated on the
        outgoing arcs. First a node token will be generated on the upper
        arc (though order of arc execution is not guaranteed).
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts3-2.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        This arc leads to a node which can be executed. The arc token
        will be completed and a node token will be placed in the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Approval 1</em></span>
        node.
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts3-3.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        Here the node token will enter a wait state. Since no further execution
        can take place here, an arc token will now be generated on the
        second outgoing arc.
</p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts3-4.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        Again, since node
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Approval 2</em></span>
        can be executed immediately, the arc token will be completed and
        a node token will be created. It will also enter into a wait
        state once the notification to the user has been created.
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts3-5.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        At some point one of the approvals will be completed. Let's say
        that it's
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Approval 2</em></span>
        . This will mark the node token complete and generate an arc
        token on the outgoing arc.
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts3-6.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        Now the engine will see if the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Grant</em></span>
        node can be executed. However, as the dashed border indicates,
        the <span class="emphasis"><em>Grant</em></span> node is using the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>label-and join strategy</em></span>.
        .
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
            <span class="emphasis"><em>label-and join strategy</em></span>
            - When an arc token arrives a node using the label-and join
            strategy, arc tokens must exist on all other arcs
            <span class="emphasis"><em>with the same name</em></span>
            before the node will accept a node token.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        Since there are two arcs with the 'default' name coming into
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Grant</em></span>
        , and only one of them has an arc token, the node can not be
        executed at this time. Execution will halt at this point.
      </p><p>
        At some point later, the token at
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Approval 1</em></span>
        is completed. This generates an arc token on the outgoing node.
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts3-7.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        Now when the engine tries to execute
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Grant</em></span>
        it finds arc tokens on all the incoming 'default' arcs. These
        arc tokens are marked complete and a node token is generated on
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Grant</em></span>
        .
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts3-8.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        Once the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Grant</em></span>
        task is finished, its node token will also be completed and the
        process will be complete.
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts3-9.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p></div><div class="section" title="Multithreading"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="concepts-multithreading"></a>Multithreading</h3></div></div></div><p>
        As seen the previous example, a process may have multiple tokens
        active concurrently. Does this imply that each token executes in
        a separate thread? No. Concurrency here is like that of multiple
        programs running on a single chip. Each runs in turns, but may
        present the appearance of running simultaneously.
</p><p>
        However, true multithreading can be done at the node level. Each node when
        executed, may hand off its work to a background thread. The node
        token will then enter a wait state, and other nodes may be
        executed. When the background task is complete, it may then
        complete the node token, allowing further execution.
</p><p>
        Note that only one thread may safely execute the process at any given
        time, and care must be taken to serialize access to the process
        itself.

        Lets now take a look at the same process, except now the approvals will
        be done by software and will not require a wait state.
</p><p>
        The execution will be the same up to the point where
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Approval 1</em></span>
        is executing.
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts3-3.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        Previously, the node token went into a wait state. This time, the approval is
        done synchronously and the token will be completed. This will
        generate an arc token on the outgoing arc.
</p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts3-10.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        Again, the <span class="emphasis"><em>Grant</em></span>
        node is using the label-and join strategy, so it will wait for an arc token on the
        other incoming arc before executing. Execution will continue on
        the lower outgoing arc of
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Request</em></span>
        .
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts3-11.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        Execution will continue into
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Approval 2</em></span>
        .
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts3-12.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        This execution will also finish synchronously and an arc token will be
        generated on the outgoing arc.
</p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts3-13.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        Execution will finish as before now that all required incoming arcs have
        tokens on them.
</p></div><div class="section" title="Flow Control with Guards using Skip"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="concepts-flow-control-skip"></a>Flow Control with Guards using Skip</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Now that we've seen how execution can split across arcs and join strategies
        can bring current executions back together, let us examine how
        to select which outgoing arcs receive tokens and which nodes get
        executed.
</p><p>
        This example uses almost the same process as the previous example. The
        difference is that either or both approvals may be optional,
        depending on what is being requested.
</p><p>
        Let us pick up execution after the request has been entered and an arc
        token generated on the upper arc:
</p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts3-2.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        Now the node token will be generated in
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Approval 1</em></span>
        .
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts3-3.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        However, remember that this does
        <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
        mean that the node will immediately execute. First the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>guard</em></span>
        must be invoked. Up until now, the guard has always been assumed
        to just return
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Accept</em></span>
        . This time however, the guard is intelligent. It will check to
        see if this approval is required. If not, it will return a
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Skip</em></span>
        response.
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Skip</em></span>
            - A guard response which indicates that the node should not
            be executed, but that execution should continue on the
            outgoing nodes. An arc name may be specifying indicated
            which arcs should be used. If no arc name is given, arcs
            with the default name (unnamed arcs) will be used.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        Assume that
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Approval 1</em></span>
        is not required. The node token will marked as having skipped
        the node, and execution will continue on the outgoing arc.
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts3-16.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p></div><div class="section" title="Flow Control with Guards using Discard"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="concepts-flow-control-discard"></a>Flow Control with Guards using Discard</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Having seen Skip, let us examine how to use the Discard response from
        guards. The same basic process definition is used, only this
        time, the assumption is that only one of the guards is required.
      </p><p>
        The graph now looks like:
</p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts4.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        Because we are using discard, only one token will reach
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Grant</em></span>. This is why the <span class="emphasis"><em>Grant</em></span>
        node is no longer a <span class="emphasis"><em>label-and join stragy</em></span>.
      </p><p>
        Execution begins as normal. We pick up execution where a node
        token has been generated in <span class="emphasis"><em>Approval 1</em></span>.
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts4-3.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        In this case, the guard determines that
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Approval 1</em></span>
        is not required, and returns a
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Discard</em></span>
        response.
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Discard</em></span>
            - A guard response indicating that the node token should be
            marked as discard, the node should
            <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
            be executed and no tokens will be generated on outgoing
            arcs.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        The process now looks like:
</p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts4-4.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        The node token has been discarded, and execution has continued
        from the completion of
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Request</em></span>
        where an arc token has been generated on the lower outgoing arc.
        Execution will now continue.
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts4-5.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Approval 2</em></span>
        will accept its node token and will continue normally.
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts4-6.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts4-7.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        Remember, because
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Grant</em></span>
        is using the <span class="emphasis"><em>or join strategy</em></span>, it will have a node token generated on
        it as soon as any arc tokens arrived.
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts4-8.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p></div><div class="section" title="Flow Control with Guards using Named Arcs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="concepts-flow-control-guards-named-arcs"></a>Flow Control with Guards using Named Arcs</h3></div></div></div><p>
        This same basic process could be implemented using a guard which returns
        Skip along with an arc name.
</p><p>
        In this variant, a
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Select</em></span>
        node has been inserted after
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Request</em></span>
        . This node has no functionality, it only exists to give the
        guard a place to run.
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts5.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        Let us pick it up after process started, as
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Select</em></span>
        has a node token generated on it, and its guard is invoked.
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts5-3.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        The
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Select</em></span>
        guard will return a
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Skip</em></span>
        response which includes the arc name on which to exit.
        <span class="emphasis"><em>All arcs with this name will have an arc token
          generated on them</em></span>
        . In this case, let us say the guard determines that
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Approval 2</em></span>
        is required. It returns
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Skip two</em></span>
        . An arc token is then generated on all arcs named
        <span class="emphasis"><em>two</em></span>
        (of which is there only one in this case).
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts5-4.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        From here execution continues as normal.
</p></div><div class="section" title="Flow Control from Node Completion using Named Arcs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="concepts-flow-control-completion-named-arcs"></a>Flow Control from Node Completion using Named Arcs</h3></div></div></div><p>
        As mentioned previously, when a node token is completed, an arc name
        must be specified. Arc tokens will be generated on all outgoing
        arcs with that name. So the previous example could also be
        implemented like this:
</p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts6.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        Instead of using the guard on the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Select</em></span>
        node, the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Request</em></span>
        node will specify which arc to exit on.
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts6-1.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        If we again specify
        <span class="emphasis"><em>two</em></span>
        , then an arc token will be generated on that arc.
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts6-2.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        From there, execution will continue.
