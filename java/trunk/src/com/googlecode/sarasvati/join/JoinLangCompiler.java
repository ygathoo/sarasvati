/**
 * JoinLang is a simple language for defining join requirements
 *
 * <pre>
 *   PROGRAM = (REQUIRESET) ('or' REQUIRESET)*
 *   REQUIRESET = REQUIREMENT (REQUIREMENT)*
 *   REQUIREMENT = 'require' 'node' <node name> WHEN?
 *               | 'require' 'tokenset' <token set name> WHEN?
 *
 *   WHEN = 'when' EXPR
 * </pre>
 *
 * A JoinLang program is made up of requirements, grouped in require sets.
 * Require sets are separated by 'or's. The requirements in a require set
 * are implicitly anded.
 *
 * Rules of evaluation:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>
 *     Requirement sets will be evaluated from first to last. Evaluation
 *     will stop with the first requirement set that returns either a join
 *     completion or join merge.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     Each requirement will be marked as applicable or non-applicable.
 *     A requirement with either no <code>when</when> clause or a
 *     <code>when</code> clause that evaluates to true will marked
 *     as applicable, otherwise it will be marked non-applicable.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     Each requirement will be evaluated to see if it is satisfied.
 *     As part of this evaluation, which tokens are involved in
 *     meeting the requirement will be tracked.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     If all applicable requirements in the requirement set are
 *     satisfied, then the join will be completed. All tokens which
 *     were involved in the join (for applicable and non-applicable
 *     requirement) will be completed in the join.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     Otherwise, when all applicable requirements in the requirement set are not
 *     satisfied a merge will be attempted. If there exist any optional tokens
 *     (those affected by non-applicable requirements) and there exist any
 *     non-backtracked node tokens on the joining node, the optional tokens will be
 *     merged into the newest, non-backtracked node token.
 *   <li>
 *   <li>
 *     If a merge is not possible, because there are no optional tokens, or no
 *     valid node tokens on the join node, the next requirement set will be
 *     evaluated. If this is the last requirement set, an incomplete join
 *     action will be returned.
 *   </li>
 * </ol>
