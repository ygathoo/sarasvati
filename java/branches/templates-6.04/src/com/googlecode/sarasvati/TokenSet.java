 * A token set is way of associating tokens together and allowing them to have
 * state relative to one another. This takes two forms:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Each token has an index in the token set. This allows a token in the
 *       set to be distinguished from other (useful for template style nodes).
 *   <li>The token set has it's own environment. The token set environment may
 *       contain attributes visible to all tokens in the set, or just tokens
 *       with a specific index.
