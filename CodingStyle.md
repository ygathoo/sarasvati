# Introduction #

Maintaining a certain level of consistency helps keep a project maintainable. Please adhere to the following coding conventions.

## Coding Style ##
When working with Sarasvati, or submitting patches, please use the following code formatting preferences:

  * Two space indent
  * Always use spaces, never tabs for indentation
  * Braces on next line
  * method declarations should have a space after the method name, no spaces around the arguments
  * function invocations should have no space after the method name, spaces around the arguments

The eclipse formatter preferences can be imported from [http://sarasvati.googlecode.com/svn/java/trunk/doc/sarasvati-formatter-prefs.xml](here.md).


## Documentation ##
All interfaces must be fully documented. Implementation classes should be documented as well, but this is less critical.
